## Google Authentication, how to get a login-password instead

If you created your GoLogin account using Sign in with Google, you won't be able to use a login and password to enter the account at first.

You might want to set up a login and password if you:

- Need to change your GoLogin password without altering your Google account password
- Want to update the email associated with your GoLogin account
- Need to enable two-factor authentication for your GoLogin account
- Find it more convenient

To get your login and password, follow the steps from [**Reset a password when logged out**](https://docs.gologin.com/account-migration-support/account-and-billing/google-auth-password-change-2fa#reset-a-password-when-logged-out-forgotten-password) guide just above. It will let you use the login-password authentication instead of Continue with Google. 

## Setting up the two-factor authentication

**Two-factor authentication** or **2FA** is a user identification method that uses two different types of authentication data. The introduction of an additional level of security provides more effective protection of your account from unauthorized access.

To enable the two-step verification function in your GoLogin account, follow the instructions below:

1. Go to the **main menu** \> **Settings & Members**
2. Click the**Two-Step Verification ** tab
3. Click **Install**, you will see the QR code
4. On your iOS or Android phone, install the **Google Authenticator **app
5. Tap **\+** \> **Scan the QR code**
6. As soon as the code is scanned, give a name to your new 2FA authentication method and **confirm the changes**

Done\! Once completed, your GoLogin account will require a verification code from the Google Authenticator app during login, significantly enhancing your account's security.
