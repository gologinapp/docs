## Google Authentication

If you created your GoLogin account using Sign in with Google, you won't be able to use a login and password to enter the account at first.

You might want to set up a login and password if you:

- Need to change your GoLogin password without altering your Google account password
- Want to update the email associated with your GoLogin account
- Need to enable two-factor authentication for your GoLogin account
- Find it more convenient

To get your login and password, follow the steps from **Resetting your forgotten password** guide just above. It will let you use the login-password authentication instead of Continue with Google.
