Now you can choose your subscription plan by clicking **Change plan**, the promo code will be applied at checkout.

## When the promo code can be activated

The coupon code can be activated if you did not subscribe on the account before, it is available for the first monthly subscription only. 

There are no promo codes for the yearly subscription, as it provides the 50% discount automatically.

It cannot be activated in several cases:

- promo code is invalid or expired
- you have previously used a promo code

## Where to get a code

Promo codes can be found in various places online. We recommend searching on the internet. Please note that our support team does not have promo codes available, so thereâ€™s no need to pressure our agents for it :)
