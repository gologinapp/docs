## Changing your payment method

Currently, you cannot change the payment method without making a payment. Here's what you can do:

- remove the current payment method at the **main menu at the top-right \>** **Settings & Members \> Billing Plans \> Payment Methods \> Delete the payment method**

- wait for the current plan to elapse and purchase a new one with the new card or PayPal

You can also purchase the new plan immediately while your current plan is active, to update your payment method.

## Cancelling the subscription

If you want to cancel the current subscription, you just need to remove your payment method from your account. Go to the **main menu at the top-right \>** **Settings & Members \> Billing Plans \> Payment Methods \> Delete the payment method**
