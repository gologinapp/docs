## Installation process

### Windows

1. Download the app installer from [here](https://gologin.com/download/)
2. Navigate to your **Downloads** folder

### Linux, Ubuntu example

GoLogin for Linux is supplied as an **AppImage** file. It does not get installed on your system in a regular sense. The app is contained within a single file and you can always access the app in the extracted file.

1. Download the AppImage file using this [link](https://gologinteam.slack.com/archives/C03JMQ7N3KM/p1718199757259269?thread_ts=1717430061.753839&cid=C03JMQ7N3KM)
2. Navigate to your **Downloads** folder
3. Right-click on the **gologin.tar** \> **Extract**
4. Go to the **gologin** folder \> launch the GoLogin by doubleclicking it

**If the app doesn't open**

- you might need to make it executable:\
  in terminal, `cd ~/Downloads/gologin` \> `chmod +x filename`\
  replace `filename` with the actual file name
- you might need a libfuse2 package on newer system:\
  in terminal, `sudo apt install libfuse2`, then try launching it again
