title: 'What is browser automation'
---

Browser automation is the process of programmatically controlling a web browser to perform tasks without human interaction. It allows you to script browser actions like navigating websites, filling forms, clicking buttons, and extracting data, enabling repetitive tasks to be executed automatically at scale.

# Why should I automate browser
People automate browsers to save time on repetitive tasks, scale operations across multiple accounts, perform consistent testing, scrape web data efficiently, monitor website changes, automate form submissions, and handle workflows that would be tedious or impossible to do manually.

# How browser automation works?
Browser automation works by using programming languages and specialized libraries to control browser actions through APIs. The software interacts with the browser's internal functions, sending commands to navigate pages, interact with elements, extract data, and monitor eventsâ€”all without requiring manual intervention. You just need to setup a script that will do repetative actions for you!
