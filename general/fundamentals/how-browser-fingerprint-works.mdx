title: 'How Browser Fingerprinting Works'
---

Browser fingerprinting is a sophisticated tracking technique used by websites to identify and track users across the internet. Unlike cookies, fingerprinting doesn't store anything on your device but instead creates a unique profile based on your browser's characteristics and settings.

## What is Browser Fingerprinting?

Browser fingerprinting involves collecting various data points from your browser and device to create a unique identifier. This identifier can be used to recognize and track you across different websites, even if you clear cookies or use private browsing mode.

Key data points collected include:

- **User Agent**: Information about your browser and operating system
- **Screen Resolution**: The dimensions of your display
- **Timezone**: Your current timezone
- **Language Settings**: Your preferred language settings
- **Installed Plugins and Fonts**: The unique combination of plugins and fonts installed
- **Canvas Fingerprinting**: Using HTML5 Canvas to render images that vary slightly based on hardware/software
- **WebGL Fingerprinting**: Similar to canvas, but leverages 3D rendering differences
- **Audio Fingerprinting**: Analyzing how your device processes audio
- **Hardware Information**: Details about your CPU, GPU, and other hardware components

## How GoLogin Protects Against Fingerprinting

GoLogin's anti-detect browser technology tackles fingerprinting by:

### 1. Browser Profile Customization

GoLogin allows you to create fully customizable browser profiles with unique fingerprints that mimic real users:

- Configure user agents, languages, and timezone settings
- Set custom screen resolutions and color depths
- Customize WebRTC, Canvas, WebGL, and other fingerprint parameters
- Define geolocation data that matches your proxy settings

### 2. Fingerprint Consistency

GoLogin ensures that all fingerprint parameters remain consistent across sessions, preventing detection through inconsistencies:

- All browser APIs return the same configured values
- Hardware-level identifiers remain stable within each profile
- Canvas, WebGL, and audio fingerprints maintain consistency

### 3. Isolation Between Profiles

Each GoLogin browser profile operates in complete isolation:

- No data sharing between profiles
- Separate cookie storage and cache
- Independent proxy connections
- Isolated browser extensions

## Real-World Applications

GoLogin's fingerprinting protection is essential for:

- **Multi-account management**: Maintain multiple accounts on the same platform without triggering anti-fraud systems
- **E-commerce**: Access regional pricing and promotions without detection
- **Web scraping and automation**: Collect data while avoiding blocks and CAPTCHAs
- **Privacy protection**: Browse the web without persistent tracking
