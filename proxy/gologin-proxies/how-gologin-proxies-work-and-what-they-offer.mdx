## Available proxy types

Gologin proxies provide following proxy types:
- **Residential Rotating**: Safe for account management and creating new accounts.
- **Mobile Rotating**: The safest option if you need extra security and want to avoid being blocked, though they may be slower.
- **Data Center Sticky**: The fastest of the bunch, not as secure. You can use them on some websites.
