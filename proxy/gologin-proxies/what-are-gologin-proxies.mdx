Gologin proxies are IP addresses **integrated directly into the GoLogin browser**. When a proxy is attached to a browser profile, it defines **where your internet traffic comes from** and helps websites see each profile as a **separate, real user**.

This approach prevents websites and platforms from **linking multiple accounts together** based on IP address data and reduces the risk of blocks, restrictions, or security checks.

## Built-in Proxies vs Custom Proxies

Gologin supports **two ways to use proxies**, depending on your needs and experience level.

- **Built-in proxies**
 Built-in proxies are **provided and managed by Gologin**. They are ready to use, require no external setup, and work seamlessly with our browser fingerprinting system.
 They are the best option if you want a **simple, stable, and fast setup** without dealing with third-party services.

- **Custom proxies**
 Custom proxies are **purchased from third-party providers** and manually added to Gologin. This option gives you more flexibility in choosing proxy providers, locations, and proxy formats.
 These are better suited for **advanced users** who need more control over their proxy infrastructure.

Built-in proxies are ideal for **simplicity and reliability**, while custom proxies offer **more control** for advanced setups.

## Types of Gologin Proxies

Depending on your plan and needs, Gologin may offer different proxy types, such as:

- **Residential proxies** – real user IPs, suitable for most platforms

- **Mobile proxies** – IPs from mobile networks, useful for higher trust environments

- **Datacenter proxies** – faster and cheaper, but easier to detect

Each type fits different tasks and risk levels.
