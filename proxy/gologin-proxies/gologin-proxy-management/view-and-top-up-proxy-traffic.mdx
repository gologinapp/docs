## How to top up traffic

If you need more traffic, you can purchase it in just a few steps:
1. Click **Buy proxy**
2. Click **Top up** next to the proxy type you want to add traffic to
3. **Select the traffic amount**
 The required amount depends on your use case. It mostly varies based on:
   - How often you use your browser profiles  
   - How long your sessions last  
   - How much heavy content (such as videos, images, or audio) you load while working
4. **Choose a payment method**
 We accept **Credit Card** and **Cryptocurrency** payments for proxy traffic.
5. **Complete the payment** in the browser window

Once the payment is completed, the traffic will be **added automatically** to your account and available for use right away.

## Adding proxy traffic into Gologin subscription

If you have a general idea of how much **residential proxy traffic** you need each month, you can add it directly to your subscription. This allows you to **avoid manual top-ups** and ensures that proxy traffic is added automatically on a monthly basis.

To add the Gologin proxy traffic into your subscription:
1. Open the **main menu** and go to **Settings & Members**.
2. Navigate to **Billing plans**.
3. Click **Change plan**.
4. **Select the required amount** of proxy traffic that will be added to your account every month.
5. **Complete the payment** in the browser window.

If you don't use all your proxy traffic from the previous month, the unused traffic will **carry over** and be added to the new monthly amount.
Gologin proxy traffic does not expire.
