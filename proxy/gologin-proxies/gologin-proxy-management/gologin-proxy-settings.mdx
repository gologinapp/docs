## Available proxy settings

If you need to configure specific proxy parameters, you must **create a new proxy connection**.
>Note: You cannot change the settings of an existing proxy connection.

To create a new custom Gologin proxy:
1. Click **Choose location or proxy** in the browser profile.
2. Click the **arrow** next to the selected proxy country.
3. Select **Add new server**.  
   Here, you can configure the following parameters:
   - **City** - available for some of the most popular countries
   - **Name** - a custom name for the proxy connection
   - **Proxy type** - residential, mobile, or datacenter
4. Click **Connect** to apply the new proxy.

## Checking connection and viewing proxy info

To verify that the proxy is working correctly and that you have enough available traffic, click the **circular arrows** icon next to the proxy flag.
From this menu, you can also view:
- **City**
- **IP address**
- **Proxy type**
- **Remaining traffic**

This helps you quickly confirm that the proxy is active and configured as expected.
