### How do I choose the proxy type?

To choose the proxy type for your new connection, just create a new proxy server by clicking **Choose location or proxy on the profile > arrow next to the country > Add new server > choose the proxy type**.

### How much traffic do I need?

The required amount depends on your use case. It mostly varies based on:
   - How often you use your browser profiles  
   - How long your sessions last  
   - How much heavy content (such as videos, images, or audio) you load while working

### What happens when I spend all my proxy traffic? Will I get detected?

If your traffic elapses mid-use, Gologin just disconnects your profiles from the internet and you won't be able to use them until you top up the traffic or swap to a third-party proxy.
You will be able to close the profiles without data loss, as the profile sync don't use proxy traffic.
