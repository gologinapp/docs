### What is it?

Before purchasing the proxy, it's important to make sure that the target website actually opens and does not block the IP address.

**Website Checker** is a simple online tool that shows whether a specified website is accessible through GoLogin proxies. You enter a URL, choose the proxy type (residential, mobile, or datacenter) and the location, and then get the check result.

Additionally, you will have a general idea of the Gologin proxy **fraud score, available ASN and IPs** in desired regions \ proxy types.
