title: "What is a proxy"
---

A **proxy** is a tool that acts as a middleman between your device and the internet. It hides your real IP address by replacing it with its own, allowing you to appear as if you're browsing from a different location.

When combined with GoLogin, a proxy helps you completely hide your digital identity, pairing a new IP address with a new browser fingerprint for better anonymity.

## Why proxy is essential

**Yes\! A proxy is essential for most tasks you want to accomplish with GoLogin.** Whether it is managing multiple social media accounts, web scraping, digital marketing or something else, it is impossible to break the link between your personal and work fingerprint without the proxy.

Without a proxy, even if you're using GoLogin Browser Profiles with unique fingerprints, websites can still link them to your real IP address or detect that multiple accounts are being managed from a single IP.

## Where to get a proxy

There are lots of third-party proxy providers out there and they all will work with GoLogin\! We’ve compiled a list of trusted providers that we recommend — check it out [**<u>here</u>**](https://gologin.com/proxies/proxy-type/).
