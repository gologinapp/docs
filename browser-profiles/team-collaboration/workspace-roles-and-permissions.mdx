## Roles

Whether you are giving access to **folders** or to a **workspace**, there is a set of roles and permissions available:

| Role                  | View, Run | Create, Edit, Clone, Delete | Share, Transfer | Share and Transfer Folders | Invite Team Members |
| :-------------------- | :-------: | :-------------------------: | :-------------: | :------------------------: | :-----------------: |
| Can run               | âœ…         | ðŸš«                          | ðŸš«              | ðŸš«                         | ðŸš«                  |
| Can edit              | âœ…         | âœ…                           | ðŸš«              | ðŸš«                         | ðŸš«                  |
| Folder full access    | âœ…         | âœ…                           | âœ…               | ðŸš«                         | ðŸš«                  |
| Workspace full access | âœ…         | âœ…                           | âœ…               | âœ…                          | âœ…                   |

As you can see, your team member will gain control over your folders and members only if they have workspace-wide access.
