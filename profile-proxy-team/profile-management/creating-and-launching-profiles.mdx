---

## Overview

A **browser profile** is a generated set of browser parameters, that the browser uses to mimic a unique physical device and user. Each profile acts as a distinct digital persona, offering a unique fingerprint and customizable settings.

There are three ways to create new profiles.

## Quick profile

This is the way to quickly add a new profile according to the default settings. Suits the most use cases.\
To create a quick profile, **go to All profiles tab \> click the \+ button at the top-left.**

## Custom profile

Use it in case you need to tweak some settings. Before the profile is created, you get to choose various parameters like the operating system, proxies or other advanced settings.

To add a profile this way, **go to All profiles tab \> click the Add profile button.**

You can then edit the profile settings and just click the **Create Profile** button to save them and create a profile.

## Adding profiles in bulk

You can also create up to 30 profiles at once. Most of the settings will be by default, some of them you will get to change right after the profile creation.

To add multiple profiles at once, **click the arrow next to the Add profile button \> set the number of profiles to create \> click Add multiple profiles.**

To stop a profile when it's launched, **close the browser with X** as you close any other window or hit **Stop** on the profile.\
**Note**: wait for the ready profile state before closing the GoLogin app, as it is important to wait for the profile data to sync with the servers. A failed uploading process may result in the data loss\!
