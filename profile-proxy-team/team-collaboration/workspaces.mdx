## Introduction

A **Workspace** is a team-based space that allows you to manage and share browser profiles securely with multiple users. Instead of everyone using their own profiles or accounts, your team can work under one Workspace with controlled access and real-time profile sync, using a single subscription plan.

Once you've registered on GoLogin, **you already have your first workspace**. If you have the sufficient subscription plan, you can start adding the team members right away.

## Purchasing the Team Member seats

By default, you have one additional Team Member seat on the Business, Enterprise and Custom plans. To get more seats for collaboration in the bigger teams, you can purchase more seats:

1. Go to the **main menu** at the top-right \> **Settings & Members**
2. At the **Billing Plans** tab, click **Change plan**
3. Locate your current plan and **set the required amount of additional seats**
4. Click **Pay now** and proceed with the payment to apply changes

## Access options

You can share access to the whole workspace or just to the selected folders:

- **Workspace access** - provides access to your whole workspace, including all the profiles and folders.
- **Selected folders** - gives permission to access the selected folders only. The team member will not be able to manage folders.

## How to create more workspaces

In case you have several teams to manage and a single workspace does not fit your needs, here's how to create a new one. Keep in mind that you will need to purchase a separate subscription for it.

## Renaming your workspace

1. Navigate to the **main menu** \> **Settings & Members**
2. In the Settings & Members tab, locate the workspace name and **click the pencil icon** next to it
3. **Change the workspace name**, the change will be applied automatically
