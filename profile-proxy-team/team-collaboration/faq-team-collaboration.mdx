## Workspaces & Folders

### Are proxies also shared?

For now, proxies are not shared between the accounts. You will need to share third-party proxies separately.

## Sharing profiles

### I get a "You've reached max shares number. To share more update your plan"

That means you've reached the limit of the available shares on your plan. You can learn more about how many shares you have on your plan [here](https://gologin.com/pricing/) under the **Profile Shares** section.

### Can I purchase more shares for my plan?

Purchasing more shares separately is not available for now. To share more profiles, try using a Workspace or Folder sharing.

### Can I free up shares?

Sure, you can remove some of the existing shares to free up the space for the new ones\!
