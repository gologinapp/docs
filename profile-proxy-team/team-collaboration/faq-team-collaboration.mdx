## Workspaces & Folders

### Are proxies also shared?

Currently, only the proxies that are set to the profile are shared. The proxy list of the workspace owner is not shared, you'll need to share them with your team members manually.

## Sharing profiles

### I get a "You've reached max shares number. To share more update your plan"

That means you've reached the limit of the available shares on your plan. You can learn more about how many shares you have on your plan [here](https://gologin.com/pricing/) under the **Profile Shares** section.

### Can I purchase more shares for my plan?

At the moment, it's **not possible** to purchase additional shares separately. If you need to share more profiles, we recommend using **Workspace** or **Folder sharing** instead.

### Can I free up shares?

Sure\! You can remove some of the existing shares to free up the space for the new ones.
