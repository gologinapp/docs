title: "Sharing profiles"
---

If you need to share just one or a couple of profiles, you don't have to use Workspaces for that: you can use the **Share profile** feature directly from your profile list\!

## How to share a profile

1. Hover over the **three dots** on a profile \> **Share**
2. Enter the **user email**
3. Select a **role**:\
   **Can run **- can **view **and **run** the profiles you shared

   **Can edit** - can **run**, **clone**, and **edit** the settings of the profiles you shared

   **Full access** - the same as **edit **but also can **share **profiles
4. Click **Share** to apply changes

After the share is applied, the profile will appear in the colleague's profile list.\
**Note**: you can share multiple profiles at once using the bulk actions.

To remove a share you can **click on the role** \> **Remove**

## What counts as a profile share

**1 share = 1 instance of a shared profile.**\
For example: if you share **2 profiles to 5 people** or **10 profiles to a single colleague**, in both cases it will use up **10 shares**.

Only the existing shares are counted towards the limit. If you remove some of the unnecessary shares, you will regain back the sharing slots.
